## The following is highly experimental!!!
## It is used to automatically delete iOS device support files and keeps

# 2: reverse sort folders - use file name major version as key
# folders=$(find ${HOME}/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS\ DeviceSupport -type d -d 1 \
#   | sort -t. -nr)

# 1: filter latest 2 major versions
# 2: remove path components after the version number
# 3: trim trailing whitespaces
